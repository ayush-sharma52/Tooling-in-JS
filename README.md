# Tooling-in-JS
This project will help you to:-
1)Get your current location coordinates and display them on map, also generate a url to share your place.
2)find a place by entering the address in the address field.(however in this case it will return a fixed location beacuase a hardcoded address is provided in the function
due to non availability of google maps API key ;) ).
3)Download the project's zip file and install the packages then serve it on using 'npm run build' command if you want to run it.
